GEN1 = pkt-gen generating UDP packets with dst port range 8000-8004
       and src port range 7000-7010;
FE   = packets belonging to port 8000 are forwarded to SWAP1, while
       packets belonging to port 8001 are forwarded to SWAP2; all
       the other packets are dropped;
SWAP = swaps UDP source and destination ports and forwards
SINK = counts the number of packets received on a given UDP port.
       SINK1 counts the number of packets received on port 7000,
       while SINK2 counts the number of packets received ont port
       7001.

SINK1 and SWAP2 run in a VM, while GEN1, FE, SWAP1 and SINK2 run
on the host.
